      <h2 class="title">Hey, Iâ€™m Jonathan!</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">I'm a product designer, storyteller, and community connector.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>Design is inclusive, but designers bring the best out of it through craft and conversation. That's what I believe design can do to elevate people and businesses.</p> -->
      <p>From shipping global products, to facilitating co-creation, to research on the ground, there's always a great story to tell. I bring them together through design, research, data, strategy, and technology.</p>
      <p>Over the past 10+ years, I've learnt to scale impact through people by designing relationships and mentorship. My passion is in the community, and I find satisfaction in connecting people. I share a lot by nature because good knowledge is worth sharing.
